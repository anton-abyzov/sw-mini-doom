# sw-mini-doom

**Framework**: SpecWeave - Specification-First Development
**Standard**: This file follows [agents.md](https://agents.md/) for universal AI compatibility

---

## Project Overview

This is a **SpecWeave project** where specifications and documentation are the source of truth.

### Core Principle
**Specification Before Implementation** - Define WHAT and WHY before HOW

### Key Concepts
- **Increments**: Feature units with spec.md (WHAT/WHY), plan.md (HOW), tasks.md (checklist)
- **Context Manifests**: Load only relevant files (70%+ token reduction)
- **Living Documentation**: Specs evolve with code, never diverge
- **Role-Based Development**: PM defines requirements, Architect designs, DevOps deploys

## 🔌 Plugin Architecture (IMPORTANT FOR NON-CLAUDE TOOLS)

### For Claude Code Users

Plugins work automatically via marketplace:
```bash
/plugin install github
```

Skills, agents, and commands are immediately available. **Skip this section if using Claude Code.**

### For Other Tools (Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.)

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Claude Code has native plugin support. **Other tools DO NOT.**

You MUST manually discover and load plugins at the start of each session:

#### Step 1: Check for Plugins

```bash
# Check if project uses plugins
ls plugins/

# Example output:
# specweave-github/
# specweave-jira/
```

If `plugins/` folder exists, proceed to Step 2.

#### Step 2: Load Plugin Components

**For EACH plugin, load its components BEFORE starting work:**

```bash
# Example: Loading GitHub plugin

# 1. Check plugin structure
ls plugins/specweave-github/

# 2. Load ALL plugin skills (like core skills)
cat plugins/specweave-github/skills/github-sync/SKILL.md
cat plugins/specweave-github/skills/github-issue-tracker/SKILL.md

# 3. Load plugin agents (if any)
cat plugins/specweave-github/agents/github-manager/AGENT.md

# 4. Note available commands (load on-demand when user requests)
ls plugins/specweave-github/commands/
# github-create-issue.md, github-sync.md, github-status.md
```

#### Step 3: Make Plugin Capabilities Available

Treat plugin components like core components:

**Plugin Skills**:
- Same activation pattern as core skills
- Check "Activates for" keywords in SKILL.md
- Follow workflow when relevant

**Plugin Agents**:
- Adopt role when needed (like core agents)
- Example: "Adopting github-manager agent role..."

**Plugin Commands**:
- Load command file when user requests action
- Example: User says "sync to GitHub" → Load `plugins/specweave-github/commands/github-sync.md`

#### Step 4: Document Loaded Plugins

At session start, note which plugins are active:

```markdown
# Session Context
- Core skills: ✅ Loaded from .claude/skills/
- Core agents: ✅ Loaded from .claude/agents/
- Plugins detected:
  - specweave-github: ✅ Loaded (2 skills, 1 agent, 4 commands)
  - specweave-jira: ✅ Loaded (1 skill, 1 agent, 2 commands)
```

### Why Manual Loading Is Required

**Claude Code**: Has native plugin marketplace, auto-loads plugins, manages dependencies.

**Other Tools**: No plugin system, so you must:
- ✅ Discover plugins in `plugins/` folder
- ✅ Read plugin skills/agents/commands manually
- ✅ Make them available in your context
- ✅ Use them like core components

**This is NOT optional** - plugins extend SpecWeave capabilities. Without loading them, you're missing critical functionality (GitHub sync, Jira integration, tech-specific skills, etc.).

### Example: Session Start Routine (Non-Claude Tools)

```bash
# 1. Load core components
cat .claude/skills/SKILLS-INDEX.md  # Core skills index
cat AGENTS.md                        # This file

# 2. Check for plugins
if [ -d "plugins" ]; then
  # 3. For each plugin, load components
  for plugin in plugins/*/; do
    echo "Loading plugin: $(basename $plugin)"

    # Load all skills
    find "$plugin/skills" -name "SKILL.md" -exec cat {} \;

    # Load all agents
    find "$plugin/agents" -name "AGENT.md" -exec cat {} \;

    # Note available commands
    ls "$plugin/commands/"
  done
fi

# 4. Now ready to work with full SpecWeave capabilities
```

### Plugin Naming Convention

Plugin commands use namespace pattern:

**Core commands** (no namespace):
- `/specweave:increment` → Core framework
- `/specweave:do` → Core framework
- `/specweave:progress` → Core framework

**Plugin commands** (with namespace):
- `/specweave:github:sync` → GitHub plugin
- `/specweave:github:create-issue` → GitHub plugin
- `/specweave:jira:sync` → Jira plugin
- `/specweave:jira:create-ticket` → Jira plugin

**In non-Claude tools**: Read the command file when user requests the action:
```bash
# User: "Sync this increment to GitHub"
# You: Load and execute command
cat plugins/specweave-github/commands/github-sync.md
# Then follow the instructions in that file
```

---

## 🚀 SpecWeave Commands (Executable Workflows)

**⚡ CRITICAL FOR NON-CLAUDE TOOLS**: Commands are NOT automatic in GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or other tools. You MUST manually discover and execute them.

### What Are Commands?

Commands are **executable workflows** defined as `.md` files in `plugins/specweave/commands/`. Each file contains:
- Command name (from filename, e.g., `specweave-increment.md` → `/specweave:increment`)
- Complete workflow instructions
- Parameters and usage examples
- Step-by-step execution guide

**Think of them as runnable scripts** - when user requests a command, you read the file and execute the workflow.

### Command Discovery (MANDATORY!)

**At the start of EVERY session**, discover available commands:

```bash
# List all core commands
ls plugins/specweave/commands/

# Common output:
# specweave-increment.md  - Plan new increment (/specweave:increment "feature")
# specweave-do.md         - Execute implementation (/specweave:do)
# specweave-done.md       - Close increment (/specweave:done 0001)
# specweave-validate.md   - Validate increment (/specweave:validate 0001)
# specweave-progress.md   - Check status (/specweave:progress)
# specweave-sync-docs.md  - Sync living docs (/specweave:sync-docs)
# specweave-next.md       - Smart increment transition (/specweave:next)
# specweave-costs.md      - Display AI cost dashboard (/specweave:costs)
# specweave-translate.md  - Translate content (/specweave:translate)
# tdd-*.md        - TDD workflow commands
# ... (17 commands total)
```

**For plugin commands** (if plugins/ folder exists):

```bash
# List plugin commands
ls plugins/specweave-github/commands/

# Example output:
# github-create-issue.md
# github-sync.md
# github-close-issue.md
# github-status.md
```

### How to Execute Commands (Step-by-Step)

**When user says**: "create new increment for user auth" or "run /specweave:increment user auth"

**You should**:

1. **Identify the command**:
   - Keywords match: "create increment" → `specweave-increment.md`
   - Explicit slash: "/specweave:increment" → `specweave-increment.md`
   - Map request to command file

2. **Read the command file**:
   ```bash
   cat plugins/specweave/commands/specweave-increment.md
   ```

3. **Parse the workflow**:
   - Read YAML frontmatter for metadata
   - Read markdown body for steps
   - Note required parameters
   - Understand expected output

4. **Execute the workflow**:
   - Follow instructions EXACTLY as written
   - Use parameters from user request
   - Reference related files (spec templates, etc.)
   - Show progress as you work

5. **Provide output**:
   - Confirm completion
   - Show created files
   - Suggest next steps

### Example: Executing /specweave:increment Command

**User says**: "create new increment for user authentication"

**Your workflow**:

```bash
# Step 1: Identify command
# "create increment" → specweave-increment.md

# Step 2: Read command file
cat plugins/specweave/commands/specweave-increment.md
```

**After reading specweave-increment.md, you learn**:
- This is PM-led increment planning
- Requires: feature description
- Creates: spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, tests.md
- Location: `.specweave/increments/####-feature-name/`

**Step 3: Execute workflow from inc.md**:

```markdown
# You see these instructions in inc.md:

1. **Detect tech stack** (TypeScript, Python, Go, etc.)
2. **PM-led planning**:
   - Market research
   - Create spec.md (WHAT & WHY)
   - Create plan.md (HOW)
   - Auto-generate tasks.md from plan
   - Create tests.md (test strategy)
3. **Strategic agent review**:
   - Architect designs system
   - Security reviews threats
   - QA defines test strategy
4. **User review checkpoint**
5. **Ready to build**
```

**Step 4: Execute those steps**:

```
📂 Creating increment 0001-user-authentication...

🔍 Tech stack detected: TypeScript + Node.js + PostgreSQL

👔 Adopting PM role to create spec.md...
   ✓ Market research: Auth requirements
   ✓ User stories: Login, Register, Password Reset
   ✓ Acceptance criteria: TC-0001 to TC-0015
   ✓ Created spec.md (WHAT & WHY, technology-agnostic)

🏗️ Adopting Architect role to create plan.md...
   ✓ Architecture: JWT + bcrypt + Prisma
   ✓ API contracts: POST /auth/login, /auth/register
   ✓ Data model: User table schema
   ✓ Created plan.md (HOW, technology-specific)

📋 Auto-generating tasks.md from plan.md...
   ✓ Generated 42 tasks with model hints
   ✓ Estimated: 3-4 weeks

🧪 Creating tests.md (QA strategy)...
   ✓ 12 test cases, 85% coverage target

✅ Increment 0001-user-authentication ready!

Next: /specweave:do (execute implementation)
```

**Step 5: Confirm completion**:

```
✅ Created increment 0001-user-authentication

Files:
  • .specweave/increments/0001-user-authentication/spec.md
  • .specweave/increments/0001-user-authentication/plan.md
  • .specweave/increments/0001-user-authentication/tasks.md
  • .specweave/increments/0001-user-authentication/tests.md

Next steps:
  1. Review generated files
  2. Run: /specweave:do (execute implementation)
```

### Core Command Reference

**Most Common** (use these daily):

| Command | File | Purpose | Example |

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Task Completion Tracking

**Problem**: Commands like `/progress`, `/validate`, `/done` rely on `tasks.md` status being accurate.
If tasks.md shows "1/24 complete" but you've actually finished 24 tasks, everything breaks!

**Solution**: Update `tasks.md` after EACH task completes.

#### For Claude Code Users (Automatic ✅)

**Good news**: This happens automatically via `post-task-completion.sh` hook!

When you complete a task (mark todo as done), the hook:
1. ✅ Detects completion
2. ✅ Updates corresponding task in tasks.md
3. ✅ Recalculates progress %
4. ✅ Syncs to GitHub issue (if enabled)

**You don't need to do anything manually!**

#### For Other AI Tools (Manual ⚠️)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: After completing EACH task, manually update tasks.md:

**Step-by-Step**:

```bash
# Example: You just completed T-001

# 1. Open tasks.md
vim .specweave/increments/0007-feature-name/tasks.md

# 2. Find the task you completed
#### T-001: Implement authentication service

# 3. Change status from pending to completed
**Status**: [ ] pending
# ↓ Change to ↓
**Status**: [x] completed

# 4. Update progress counters at the top
**Completed**: 0  # ← Increment this (0 → 1)
**Progress**: 0%  # ← Recalculate (1/24 = 4%)

# 5. Save and commit
git add .specweave/increments/0007-feature-name/tasks.md
git commit -m "chore: mark T-001 as complete"
```

**Why This Matters**:
- `/progress` shows accurate completion % ✅
- `/validate` checks pass ✅
- `/done` can close the increment ✅
- Team knows real status ✅

**Validation Check**:
```bash
# Verify tasks.md is in sync
/sync-tasks --validate

# If out of sync:
/sync-tasks  # Auto-fix from GitHub or git history
```

**Quick Reference Card** (print and keep handy):

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  AFTER EACH TASK: Update tasks.md Status      │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  1. Open: .specweave/increments/XXXX/tasks.md │
│  2. Find: #### T-XXX                           │
│  3. Change: [ ] pending → [x] completed        │
│  4. Update: Completed count & Progress %       │
│  5. Commit: git commit -m "chore: mark done"   │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Command Execution Pattern (Template)

Use this pattern for ANY command execution:

```bash
# 1. User request
# User: "sync to GitHub"

# 2. Identify command
# Keywords: "sync", "GitHub" → github-sync.md

# 3. Read command file
cat plugins/specweave-github/commands/github-sync.md

# 4. Parse workflow
# - Requires: increment ID, GitHub token
# - Creates: GitHub issue
# - Syncs: tasks, progress, labels

# 5. Execute workflow
# Follow steps in github-sync.md:
#   - Load increment
#   - Create/update GitHub issue
#   - Sync task checklist
#   - Add labels and milestone
#   - Post comment with summary

# 6. Confirm completion
# "✅ Synced increment 0001 to GitHub issue #42"
```

### Why This Matters (Claude Code vs Other Tools)

**Claude Code** (automatic):
- Commands work via native slash syntax: `/inc "feature"`
- No manual reading needed
- Commands execute automatically

**Other Tools** (manual):
- ❌ No native command support
- ✅ **Solution**: Read command .md file and execute workflow
- Commands become "pseudo-executable" via this pattern
- Same workflows, just manual discovery

**GitHub Copilot Example**:

```
User: "create increment for payments"

Copilot (you):
1. Recognize command request: "create increment" → /inc
2. Read: cat plugins/specweave/commands/inc.md
3. Execute: Follow PM-led workflow from inc.md
4. Create: spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md in .specweave/increments/0002-payments/
5. Confirm: "✅ Increment 0002-payments created"

User gets SAME result as Claude Code, just via manual execution!
```

### Command Discovery Checklist (Session Start)

**MANDATORY for non-Claude tools**:

```bash
# 1. Discover core commands
ls plugins/specweave/commands/
# Note: 17 commands available (inc, do, done, validate, etc.)

# 2. Check for plugin commands
if [ -d "plugins/specweave-github" ]; then
  ls plugins/specweave-github/commands/
  # Note: 4 GitHub commands available
fi

# 3. Document available commands
echo "Session Context:
- Core commands: 17 available (inc, do, done, validate, ...)
- Plugin commands: 4 GitHub commands (if plugin installed)
- Command execution: Read .md file → Execute workflow
"

# 4. Ready to execute commands when requested
```

### Advanced: Batch Command Execution

Some workflows require multiple commands:

**Example**: Complete increment lifecycle

```bash
# User: "Plan, build, and close user auth feature"

# Step 1: Execute /inc
cat plugins/specweave/commands/inc.md
# → Create spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md

# Step 2: Execute /do
cat plugins/specweave/commands/do.md
# → Execute all 42 tasks

# Step 3: Execute /validate
cat plugins/specweave/commands/validate.md
# → Quality checks

# Step 4: Execute /done
cat plugins/specweave/commands/done.md
# → PM validation and closure
```

### Troubleshooting

**Command file not found?**

```bash
# Check if command exists
ls plugins/specweave/commands/ | grep inc
# If not found, command doesn't exist

# Check plugin commands
ls plugins/specweave-*/commands/
```

**Command syntax unclear?**

```bash
# Read command README
cat plugins/specweave/commands/README.md
# Contains overview of all commands
```

**Command fails during execution?**

- Re-read command file for missed steps
- Check required files exist (spec.md, plan.md, etc.)
- Verify parameters are correct
- Check error messages for hints

### Summary: Making Commands Work Without Claude Code

**The Key Insight**: Commands are just markdown files with workflows!

1. **Discover**: `ls plugins/specweave/commands/`
2. **Read**: `cat plugins/specweave/commands/{command}.md`
3. **Execute**: Follow the workflow in the file
4. **Confirm**: Show completion and next steps

**Result**: GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and other tools get the SAME SpecWeave command capabilities as Claude Code, just via manual execution instead of slash syntax.

**This is CRITICAL** - without command execution, you're missing 90% of SpecWeave's automation!

---

## Available Agents (Specialized Roles)

SpecWeave uses role-based development. When working on tasks, adopt the appropriate role:



### How to Use Agents

**In Claude Code** (automatic):
- Agents activate automatically when needed
- Separate context windows for each role

**In other tools** (manual):
- Read the agent file: `.claude/agents/{agent-name}/AGENT.md`
- Adopt that role's perspective and responsibilities
- Example: "Adopting PM role to create spec.md..."

---

## 🎯 CRITICAL: Skills Are Your Expert Manuals (Read First!)

**MANDATORY**: Before starting ANY implementation task, check for relevant skills.

### What Are Skills?

Skills are **specialized expert manuals** that contain:
- Proven workflows for specific tasks
- SpecWeave conventions and best practices
- Required files to read and tools to use
- Step-by-step instructions
- Examples and test cases

**There are 34+ skills available** organized into categories:
- **Framework Core**: increment-planner, context-loader, context-optimizer
- **External Integrations**: jira-sync, ado-sync, github-sync
- **Architecture & Design**: diagrams-architect, design-system-architect
- **Development**: frontend, nodejs-backend, python-backend, nextjs, dotnet-backend
- **Quality & Testing**: increment-quality-judge, e2e-playwright
- **Infrastructure**: hetzner-provisioner, cost-optimizer
- **Documentation**: docusaurus, figma-to-code, figma-designer
- **Orchestration**: role-orchestrator, skill-router, spec-driven-brainstorming

### Progressive Disclosure Pattern (How to Use Skills)

**STEP 1: Discovery (Always Start Here)**

Before starting ANY task, read the skills index:

```bash
cat .claude/skills/SKILLS-INDEX.md
```

This single file contains ALL available skills with their activation keywords. **This is your first stop for every task.**

**STEP 2: Matching**

Look for skills whose "Activates for" keywords match your current task:

| Your Task | Relevant Skill | Keywords |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| "Plan a new feature for user auth" | `increment-planner` | "feature planning", "create increment" |
| "Sync this to JIRA" | `jira-sync` | "JIRA sync", "create JIRA issue" |
| "Create architecture diagram" | `diagrams-architect` | "architecture diagram", "C4 diagram" |
| "Implement React component" | `frontend` | "React", "components", "UI" |
| "Deploy to cloud" | `hetzner-provisioner` or `cost-optimizer` | "deploy", "hosting", "infrastructure" |
| "Quality check" | `increment-quality-judge` | "validate quality", "quality check" |
| "E2E test" | `e2e-playwright` | "E2E test", "browser automation" |
| "Generate docs site" | `docusaurus` | "documentation site", "docs" |

**STEP 3: Load Full Skill**

Once you've identified 1-3 relevant skills, load their full documentation:

```bash
cat .claude/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md
```

**STEP 4: Execute Workflow**

Follow the skill's instructions precisely:
- Read required files listed in skill
- Use recommended tools
- Follow step-by-step workflow
- Apply SpecWeave best practices

### Why This Matters (Token Savings + Quality)

**Scenario**: User asks to plan a new feature

**Without skills** (bad):
```
❌ Read entire .specweave/docs/ folder (50k tokens)
❌ Guess at SpecWeave conventions
❌ Create inconsistent increment structure
❌ Miss context-manifest.yaml (no token savings)
❌ Reinvent workflow from scratch
Result: High token cost, inconsistent output
```

**With skills** (good):
```
✅ Read SKILLS-INDEX.md (2k tokens)
✅ Match "plan feature" → increment-planner skill
✅ Load increment-planner SKILL.md (3k tokens)
✅ Follow proven workflow with templates
✅ Create proper context-manifest.yaml (70% token savings)
Result: 5k tokens vs 50k = 90% savings + higher quality
```

### Skills vs Agents (What's the Difference?)

**Skills = Capabilities (WHAT you can do)**
- increment-planner: Creates feature plans
- jira-sync: Syncs with external tools
- diagrams-architect: Creates diagrams
- **Use skills for workflows and procedures**

**Agents = Roles (WHO you become)**
- PM: Product manager perspective
- Architect: Technical design perspective
- DevOps: Infrastructure perspective
- **Use agents when you need to adopt a specific role/perspective**

### For Non-Claude Code Users

**GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.:**

Since these tools don't have native skill support, you MUST:

1. **At session start**: Always read `SKILLS-INDEX.md` first
2. **Before each task**: Check if relevant skills exist
3. **During execution**: Follow skill workflows precisely
4. **When stuck**: Re-read the relevant SKILL.md

**Treat this as mandatory**, not optional. Skills are the difference between:
- Inconsistent ad-hoc work ❌
- Professional SpecWeave-compliant output ✅

---

## Available Skills (Specialized Capabilities)

SpecWeave has specialized capabilities for different tasks:



### How to Use Skills

**In Claude Code** (automatic):
- Skills activate based on keywords in your request
- No manual invocation needed
- Claude reads SKILLS-INDEX.md at startup
- Full SKILL.md loaded when relevant

**In other tools** (manual):
- Read `.claude/skills/SKILLS-INDEX.md` first (mandatory)
- Match task to activation keywords
- Load full skill: `.claude/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`
- Follow the workflow precisely
- Example: "Following increment-planner skill workflow..."

---

## Common Workflows

### Creating a Feature Increment

**Step 1: Create Increment Folder**
```bash
mkdir -p .specweave/increments/0001-feature-name
cd .specweave/increments/0001-feature-name
```

**Step 2: Create spec.md (Adopt PM Role)**
- Focus on WHAT and WHY (not HOW)
- Technology-agnostic requirements
- User stories with acceptance criteria

Template:
```markdown
---
increment: 0001-feature-name
title: "Feature Title"
priority: P1
status: planned
---

# Increment 0001: Feature Name

## Overview
[Problem statement and solution]

## User Stories

### US-001: User Story Title
**As a** [role]
**I want to** [action]
**So that** [benefit]

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] TC-0001: [testable condition]
- [ ] TC-0002: [testable condition]
```

**Step 3: Create plan.md (Adopt Architect Role)**
- Focus on HOW (technical implementation)
- Technology-specific details
- Component design, data models, APIs

Template:
```markdown
# Technical Plan: Feature Name

## Architecture
[Component design]

## Data Model
[Database schema]

## API Contracts
[Endpoints, request/response]

## Implementation Strategy
[Step-by-step approach]
```

**Step 4: Create tasks.md**
```markdown
---
increment: 0001-feature-name
total_tasks: 10
completed_tasks: 0
---

# Implementation Tasks

- [ ] T001: Task description
- [ ] T002: Task description
```

**Step 5: Create context-manifest.yaml (CRITICAL)**
```yaml
spec_sections:
  - .specweave/docs/internal/strategy/relevant-spec.md
documentation:
  - .specweave/docs/internal/architecture/relevant-design.md
max_context_tokens: 10000
```

### Context Loading (70%+ Token Savings)

**CRITICAL RULE**: Always read `context-manifest.yaml` first!

**Why?**
- Full specs: 500+ pages (50k tokens) ❌
- Manifest files: 50 pages (5k tokens) ✅
- **Savings: 90% = 45k tokens saved!**

**How:**
1. Navigate to increment folder
2. Read `context-manifest.yaml`
3. Load ONLY files listed in manifest
4. Do NOT load entire `.specweave/docs/` folder

### Working with Slash Commands (Claude Code)

If using Claude Code, these slash commands are available:

**Core Commands** (always available):
| Command | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `/specweave:increment` | Create new increment | `/specweave:increment "user authentication"` |
| `/specweave:do` | Execute implementation | `/specweave:do` |
| `/specweave:progress` | Check status | `/specweave:progress` |
| `/specweave:done` | Close increment | `/specweave:done 0001` |
| `/specweave:validate` | Validate quality | `/specweave:validate 0001 --quality` |

**Plugin Commands** (when plugin installed):
| Command | Purpose | Plugin |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `/specweave:github:sync` | Sync to GitHub | specweave-github |
| `/specweave:github:create-issue` | Create GitHub issue | specweave-github |
| `/specweave:jira:sync` | Sync to Jira | specweave-jira |
| `/specweave:jira:create-ticket` | Create Jira ticket | specweave-jira |

**For non-Claude tools**: Read the command file when user requests the action:
```bash
# User: "Sync to GitHub"
cat plugins/specweave-github/commands/github-sync.md
# Then follow instructions in that file
```

---

## Build & Test Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build project
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Run E2E tests (if applicable)
npm run test:e2e

# Type check
npm run type-check

# Lint
npm run lint
```

---

## Code Style Guidelines

### Specification Files

**spec.md** (Technology-Agnostic):
- Focus on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- Use user stories (US-001, US-002, ...)
- Use acceptance criteria (TC-0001, TC-0002, ...)
- No technology-specific details

**plan.md** (Technology-Specific):
- Focus on HOW to implement
- Include component designs, data models, APIs
- Reference ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- Technology stack details

### Code Organization

**ALL supporting files belong to an increment:**
- Logs → `.specweave/increments/{id}/logs/`
- Scripts → `.specweave/increments/{id}/scripts/`
- Reports → `.specweave/increments/{id}/reports/`
- NEVER create supporting files in project root

**Benefits:**
- Complete traceability (know which increment created which files)
- Easy cleanup (delete increment folder = delete all related files)
- Clear context (all files for a feature in one place)

---

## Testing Strategy

**Four Levels of Test Cases**:

1. **Specification** (`.specweave/docs/internal/strategy/`) - TC-0001 acceptance criteria
2. **Feature** (`.specweave/increments/####/tests.md`) - Test coverage matrix
3. **Skill** (`src/skills/{name}/test-cases/`) - YAML test cases (if creating skills)
4. **Code** (`tests/`) - Automated tests (Unit, Integration, E2E)

**Requirements:**
- E2E tests (Playwright/Cypress) when UI exists
- >80% coverage for critical paths
- Tests MUST tell the truth (no false positives)

---

## 📝 Documentation Updates (CRITICAL FOR NON-CLAUDE TOOLS)

**IMPORTANT**: Claude Code has automatic hooks that remind you to update documentation. **GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and other tools DO NOT have these hooks!**

### You MUST Manually Update Documentation After Every Task

When you complete ANY task (implementation, bug fix, refactoring), you MUST update:

#### 1. Living Docs (.specweave/docs/)

After implementing features, update strategic documentation:

**Strategy Docs** (`.specweave/docs/internal/strategy/`):
- Update PRDs when requirements change
- Add new user stories if scope expanded
- Document discovered requirements

**Architecture Docs** (`.specweave/docs/internal/architecture/`):
- Update HLD (high-level design) when architecture changes
- Update LLD (low-level design) when components change
- Update ADRs from "Proposed" → "Accepted" after implementation
- Add new ADRs for significant decisions made during implementation

**Delivery Docs** (`.specweave/docs/internal/delivery/`):
- Update deployment guides after infrastructure changes
- Update CI/CD docs after pipeline modifications

**Operations Docs** (`.specweave/docs/internal/operations/`):
- Update runbooks after operational changes
- Update monitoring/alerting docs

#### 2. Increment Documentation

**Always update these files in `.specweave/increments/{increment-id}/`**:

```bash
# Update implementation status
vim .specweave/increments/0001-feature/plan.md
# Add: "## Implementation Notes" section with learnings

# Update task checklist
vim .specweave/increments/0001-feature/tasks.md
# Mark completed: - [x] T001: Task description

# Document completion
vim .specweave/increments/0001-feature/reports/completion-report.md
# Add: Summary of what was implemented, challenges, solutions
```

#### 3. Project Documentation

**CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md** (this file):
- Update when project structure changes
- Add new workflows or commands
- Update "Current Work" section

**README.md** (user-facing):
- Update when features are added
- Update installation instructions if changed
- Update usage examples

**CHANGELOG.md** (version history):
- Add entries for all user-facing changes
- Format: `## [version] - date` with bullet points

#### 4. Code Documentation

**Inline comments**:
- Add JSDoc/TSDoc for new functions
- Update existing comments if behavior changes
- Explain "why" not just "what"

### When to Update (Checklist)

After you:
- ✅ Complete a task → Update increment tasks.md
- ✅ Implement a feature → Update living docs (architecture, strategy)
- ✅ Make architecture decision → Create or update ADR
- ✅ Change project structure → Update CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md
- ✅ Add user-facing feature → Update README.md
- ✅ Fix a bug → Update CHANGELOG.md
- ✅ Change API → Update API documentation
- ✅ Modify deployment → Update deployment guide

### Example Workflow (GitHub Copilot/Cursor Users)

```markdown
# After completing "Implement user authentication" task:

1. Update living docs:
   echo "## Implementation Notes
   - Used JWT for stateless authentication
   - Password hashing with bcrypt
   - Session timeout: 24 hours
   " >> .specweave/increments/0001-auth/plan.md

2. Update architecture:
   vim .specweave/docs/internal/architecture/hld-system.md
   # Add authentication component diagram

3. Create ADR:
   vim .specweave/docs/internal/architecture/adr-003-jwt-authentication.md

4. Update README:
   vim README.md
   # Add authentication usage example

5. Update CHANGELOG:
   echo "### Added
   - User authentication with JWT
   - Password reset flow
   " >> CHANGELOG.md

6. Mark task complete:
   vim .specweave/increments/0001-auth/tasks.md
   # Change [ ] to [x] for completed tasks
```

### Why This Matters

**Without documentation updates**:
- ❌ Specs diverge from implementation (specs become useless)
- ❌ Team members don't know what changed
- ❌ Future AI sessions have outdated context
- ❌ SpecWeave's core principle (living documentation) breaks down

**With documentation updates**:
- ✅ Specs stay synchronized with code
- ✅ Clear audit trail of changes
- ✅ AI agents have accurate context
- ✅ Team members stay informed
- ✅ SpecWeave philosophy is maintained

### Tools That Need Manual Updates

These tools **DO NOT** have automatic documentation hooks:
- GitHub Copilot (all versions)
- Cursor
- Windsurf
- Gemini CLI
- Generic AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude web, etc.)

Only **Claude Code** has automatic hooks that remind you to update docs.

---

## 🔗 External Tracker Sync (CRITICAL FOR NON-CLAUDE TOOLS)

**IMPORTANT**: Claude Code has automatic hooks that sync to external trackers (GitHub Issues, Jira, Azure DevOps) after each task completion. **GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and other tools DO NOT have these hooks!**

### You MUST Manually Sync to External Trackers After Every Task

When you complete ANY task, you MUST sync progress to external trackers if they are enabled for the project.

#### Step 1: Detect Which Trackers Are Enabled

Check the current increment's `metadata.json`:

```bash
# Find current increment (latest non-backlog increment)
CURRENT_INCREMENT=$(ls -t .specweave/increments/ 2>/dev/null | grep -v "_backlog" | head -1)

# Check metadata
cat .specweave/increments/$CURRENT_INCREMENT/metadata.json
```

**Example metadata.json**:
```json
{
  "id": "0007-smart-increment-discipline",
  "title": "Increment Management v2.0",
  "status": "active",
  "github": {
    "issue": 4,
    "url": "https://github.com/anton-abyzov/specweave/issues/4"
  },
  "jira": {
    "issue": "PROJ-123",
    "url": "https://company.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123"
  },
  "ado": {
    "item": 456,
    "url": "https://dev.azure.com/org/project/_workitems/edit/456"
  }
}
```

#### Step 2: Sync to Each Enabled Tracker

**For GitHub** (if `github.issue` exists):

```bash
# Get issue number
GITHUB_ISSUE=$(jq -r '.github.issue' .specweave/increments/$CURRENT_INCREMENT/metadata.json)

# Post progress comment
gh issue comment "$GITHUB_ISSUE" --body "Progress update: Task T-XXX completed in increment $CURRENT_INCREMENT

Details:
- Task: [Task description]
- Status: Completed
- Timestamp: $(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")

Next: [Next task or completion status]
"
```

**For Jira** (if `jira.issue` exists):

```bash
# Get issue key
JIRA_ISSUE=$(jq -r '.jira.issue' .specweave/increments/$CURRENT_INCREMENT/metadata.json)

# Add comment (requires jira CLI: https://github.com/ankitpokhrel/jira-cli)
jira issue comment add "$JIRA_ISSUE" "Progress update: Task T-XXX completed

Details:
- Task: [Task description]
- Status: Completed
- Increment: $CURRENT_INCREMENT
"

# Update status if task is major milestone
# jira issue move "$JIRA_ISSUE" "In Progress" / "Review" / "Done"
```

**For Azure DevOps** (if `ado.item` exists):

```bash
# Get work item ID
ADO_ITEM=$(jq -r '.ado.item' .specweave/increments/$CURRENT_INCREMENT/metadata.json)

# Add comment (requires az CLI: https://aka.ms/azure-cli)
az boards work-item update --id "$ADO_ITEM" --discussion "Progress update: Task T-XXX completed

Details:
- Task: [Task description]
- Status: Completed
- Increment: $CURRENT_INCREMENT
"
```

#### Step 3: When to Sync

**After EVERY task completion**, sync to all enabled trackers:

```bash
# Example workflow after completing T-003:

# 1. Mark task complete in tasks.md
vim .specweave/increments/0007-feature/tasks.md
# Change: - [ ] T003: Task → - [x] T003: Task ✅

# 2. Update increment documentation (plan.md, etc.)
# [See "Documentation Updates" section above]

# 3. Sync to external trackers
gh issue comment 4 --body "✅ T-003 Complete: Create test-aware-planner structure

Directory structure created at plugins/specweave/agents/test-aware-planner/

Next: T-004 - Write test-aware-planner AGENT.md prompt
"

# 4. Continue to next task
```

#### Step 4: Update Task Checklist in GitHub/Jira

**For GitHub Issues with task checklists**:

The issue body likely contains a task checklist:

```markdown
## Tasks
- [x] T-001: Update plan.md
- [x] T-002: Add auto-sync hook
- [ ] T-003: Create test-aware-planner structure
- [ ] T-004: Write AGENT.md prompt
```

**Update the checklist** after each task:

```bash
# Get current issue body
gh issue view 4 --json body -q .body > issue-body.md

# Edit the checklist (mark T-003 as done)
vim issue-body.md
# Change: - [ ] T-003 → - [x] T-003

# Update issue
gh issue edit 4 --body-file issue-body.md
```

**For Jira** (subtasks):

If tasks are represented as subtasks:

```bash
# List subtasks
jira issue list --parent PROJ-123

# Update subtask status
jira issue move PROJ-123-SUB1 "Done"
```

#### Step 5: Sync Increment Status Changes

When increment status changes (active → paused → completed), sync that too:

```bash
# Example: Increment completed
gh issue comment 4 --body "🎉 INCREMENT COMPLETED!

All 24 tasks finished. Increment 0007-smart-increment-discipline is now complete.

See completion report: .specweave/increments/0007-smart-increment-discipline/reports/COMPLETION-SUMMARY.md
"

# Close the issue
gh issue close 4 --comment "Increment completed and merged to main branch."
```

### Why This Matters

**Without external tracker sync**:
- ❌ Stakeholders don't see progress
- ❌ Team members work in isolation
- ❌ No audit trail of work done
- ❌ GitHub/Jira becomes stale and useless

**With external tracker sync**:
- ✅ Real-time visibility into progress
- ✅ Team stays informed
- ✅ Stakeholders can track without asking
- ✅ Complete audit trail
- ✅ GitHub/Jira remains the source of truth

### Tools That Need Manual Sync

These tools **DO NOT** have automatic external tracker sync:
- GitHub Copilot (all versions)
- Cursor
- Windsurf
- Gemini CLI
- Generic AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude web, etc.)

Only **Claude Code** has automatic hooks (via `post-task-completion.sh`) that sync to external trackers.

### Summary Checklist (After Every Task)

When you complete a task in non-Claude tools:

1. ✅ Mark task complete in tasks.md
2. ✅ Update living docs (see "Documentation Updates" section)
3. ✅ **Sync to GitHub/Jira/ADO** (this section)
4. ✅ Update RFC if applicable (if task implements architecture decision)
5. ✅ Continue to next task

**Remember**: In Claude Code, steps 3-4 happen automatically via hooks. In other tools, YOU must do them manually!

## Security Considerations

- Never commit secrets (use `.env` files, gitignored)
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Review security implications in ADRs
- Use the `security` agent role for security reviews

---

## Finding the Right Agent or Skill

When you encounter a new task:

**Finding Skills:**
1. Check this file (Available Skills section above)
2. Browse: `ls .claude/skills/`
3. Read: `.claude/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`
4. Follow the workflow

**Finding Agents:**
1. Check this file (Available Agents section above)
2. Browse: `ls .claude/agents/`
3. Read: `.claude/agents/{agent-name}/AGENT.md`
4. Adopt the role

**Pro Tips:**
- Skills are capabilities (what you CAN do)
- Agents are roles (who you BECOME to do it)
- When stuck, ask: "Which SpecWeave skill or agent helps with [task]?"

---

## Important Reminders

1. ✅ **Always read context-manifest.yaml first** (70%+ token savings)
2. ✅ **Load only files listed in manifest** (not entire docs folder)
3. ✅ **Adopt role when acting as agent** (PM, Architect, DevOps, etc.)
4. ✅ **Technology-agnostic in spec.md** (WHAT/WHY only)
5. ✅ **Technology-specific in plan.md** (HOW with details)
6. ✅ **Use checkboxes in tasks.md** for tracking
7. ✅ **All supporting files in increment folders** (never in root)
8. 🔴 **UPDATE DOCUMENTATION AFTER EVERY TASK** (see "Documentation Updates" section above - CRITICAL for non-Claude tools!)
